This recording of the complete 6 Partitas is a marvel of elegance, wit, rhetoric and brilliance, played on a modern Steinway. 

 “China’s premier interpreter of Bach”, is what International Piano Magazine called Yuan Sheng. A pupil of Solomon Mikowsky (Manhattan School of Music) and notably Rosalyn Tureck Yuan Sheng extensively studied the performance practice of Baroque music. Equally at home at the harpsichord he has an instinctive feeling for the possibilities, sonorities and touch of the instrument at hand, so that “the listener might easily have imagined the composer at the keyboard” (Boston Intelligencer). Besides pursuing an international career Yuan Sheng is Professor of Piano at the Bejing Central Conservatory of Music.

Composer: Johann Sebastian Bach
Artist: Yuan Sheng (piano)
